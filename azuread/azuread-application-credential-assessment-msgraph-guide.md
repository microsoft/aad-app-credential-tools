# Microsoft Graph API (recommended)

You can use Microsoft Graph application and service principal APIs to get the application or service principal resources that need to be assessed. The **keyCredential** object in the application API has a new property **hasExtendedValue** which indicates the need to rotate the credential. The following points are crucial to conducting an accurate assessment for your applications.

- The call to get an application or service principal requires the use of the `$select` query parameter to get the correct value for the **hasExtendedValue** property.
- If the APIs are called without the query parameters, the property **hasExtendedValue** will default to `null` and should not be interpreted as `false`.
- For a given credential if the value of **hasExtendedValue** is `true`, it signifies the presence of private key data and that keyCredential must be rotated.
- The property is available only in the Microsoft Graph `beta` endpoint.
- This new property will not be part of the Microsoft Graph `beta` schema.
