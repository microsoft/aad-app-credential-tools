## Remediation

Application or service principal credentials can be rotated using one of the following options.
You may use any one of the 3 options but ensure that you follow the steps as described for each option to avoid any downtime.
The steps detailed below will help you add a new credential to the application object and remove instances of previous credentials identified by the key cred scanner tool.
If the credential that needs to be rotated is expired, you can skip the steps to add a certificate and jump to the certificate removal section.
